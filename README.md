## Command-Line Arguments

| Argument  | Description | Default Value |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| --domain  | Target GitLab instance URL  | https://c40b-88-222-161-135.ngrok-free.app |
| --file_name  | Payload file  | lfs_payload_3mb.json |
| --threads  | Total Number of Threads | 7 |
| --delay  | Limits new thread creation - 1 is 1 RPS, 0.5 is 2RPS, etc.  | 1 |

## Code Explanation

`generate_lfs_objects(n)`

Generates n dummy LFS objects with sequential fake OIDs (SHA256 hashes).

`create_payload_file(file_name)`

Creates a JSON payload (e.g., lfs_payload_3mb.json) with LFS batch request data. This is useful if you don't want to regenerate payload every run.

`discover_lfs_endpoint(domain)`

Uses curl to fetch the LFS API endpoint from a GitLab instance‚Äôs public projects.

`send_test_request(payload_file, lfs_endpoint)`

Sends a test request and checks for HTTP 413 Payload Too Large errors. This is for these edge cases where maximum accepted body size is 1MB.

`send_curl_request(thread_num, payload_file, lfs_endpoint)`

Threaded function to send payloads to LFS endpoint.

Gitlab doesn't accept 99.9% of DoS vulnerabilities. This vulnerability is out-of-scope unfortunately :(.

`DoS vulnerabilities caused by unlimited input fields`

Out-of-scope bugs are useless noise (üóëÔ∏è) ‚Äî they waste time chasing irrelevant issues that don‚Äôt impact the actual target, like reporting a typo in a login page‚Äôs footer. They distract from real threats, clog reports with garbage, and show you didn‚Äôt bother reading the rules.

Submitting them is like demanding a refund for a sandwich you didn‚Äôt order.
